        <h1>Stray Dog Jumps In Front of Speeding Truck to Save Little Girl </h1>
        <img src="bor.jpg" alt="bor" align="right" height="350px" width="450px">
        <P style="font-size:25px;">A stray dog from Oklahoma City is being called hero after stepping between a vehicle and a little girl who had stepped off the curb. Appropriately named Angel, the Border Collie was injured in the accident<br/>
           <strong>A guardian angel<br/></strong> 
Detling reports that witness Charles Saxton had this to say: “He really was a watchdog. That truck came speeding down. They always do. He saved her life. Saved her from getting hit.”

According to Detling, Angel is currently at the Oklahoma City Animal Welfare Department, where he’s being treated for a fractured leg. OKC Animal Welfare Superintendent, Julie Bank said, “It really shows the power of the human animal relationship. It shows how much animals are really in tune to what we’re all about.” Angel’s surgery will be taken care of by a local vet and he is likely to be adopted by a staffer.

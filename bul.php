        <P style="font-size:25px;"> Anubis the dog amazingly survived after being shot in the head during a Monday burglary in St. Petersburg, Florida, according to Avianne Tan of ABC News. What’s even more amazing? The gunshot wound wasn’t enough to keep Anubis off his feet. Anubis, The 5-year-old Rhodesian Ridgeback was treated at one of BluePearl’s emergency veterinary clinics.<br/>
            The burglary<br/>
According to Tan, Chris Watson, pet parent to Anubis left for work like any other day, but came home to a destroyed house and then discovered something even worse. Watson told ABC News, “I tried calling out for Anubis, but he didn’t answer, so I called the police, and the K9 unit went in for me because I was too shaken up. Sure enough, Anubis came around the corner, and when he saw me, he immediately came over and put his head to my lap. That’s when I realized he was bleeding.”

Police saw a bullet hole in the dog’s scalp, and Anubis was taken to the veterinarian for further care, says Tan.
<br/>How did Anubis survive?<br/>
Tan reports that according to a BluePearl spokeswoman, Dr. Andrea Smith removed the bullet lodged in Anubis. The bullet found itself in the dog’s neck after going through his skin and grazing his skull. The spokeswoman said, “It’s incredible, he’s very fortunate. The bullet nearly missed major arteries and blood vessels.”

Watson’s sister, Ginger Brengle commented on the event and told ABC News, “There were at least 5 bullet holes, and so they were definitely aiming for the dog.”

According to Tan’s report, Watson remarked, “Anubis is my son, I can have my items stolen or my house damaged, and all that is replaceable. But Anubis? He’s family.”
<br/>Recovering<br/>
Despite the traumatic event, Anubis has been in high spirits and is expected to make a full recovery reports Tan. We wish Anubis and family the very best during this recovery.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the only burglary to endanger a pet this year.
